        <p>6.1 We will always aim to deliver your order within the stated time frame given to you when placing your
          order.</p>

        <p>6.2 As the items we supply are Perishable, the responsibility lies with the customer to ensure that the
          parcel is accepted on the day of delivery. If an attempt was made to deliver and was failed due to nobody
          being present at the primary delivery address, then the responsibility and liability for the loss of goods
          lies with the customer, in this respect no claim can be made against Hello Butcher.</p>

        <p>6.3 If nobody is available at the primary delivery address (nominated by you at the time you place your
          order) to take delivery of the order, we will leave notification of where the item is available for you to
          collect from.</p>

        <p>6.4 Our deliveries are made with “signature required”. In the event that nobody is available to take delivery
          of your order at your primary delivery address or you ask us to leave your goods unattended at a secure place,
          Hello Butcher expressly disclaims all liability that may arise in consequence of the delivery being left
          unattended, including, without limitation, theft, tampering or contamination, however caused.</p>

        <p>6.5 If your delivery is refused or not accepted at a recipient's address, we can not take responsibility for
          this and can not offer a free replacement box.</p>

        <p>6.6 Events outside our control, for example, extreme weather conditions, may occasionally mean we are unable
          to deliver your goods at the time agreed. In these circumstances, we will contact you as early as possible to
          rearrange the delivery time. In such an event, our liability to you shall be limited to the price of the goods
          ordered and the cost of delivery.</p>
